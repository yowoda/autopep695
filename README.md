# A tool to automatically upgrade python code to the new type parameter syntax introduced in [PEP 695](https://peps.python.org/pep-0695/)

Rewriting your codebase manually to comply with PEP 695 can be very tiring and confusing, especially at a large scale as you have to keep track of all the `TypeVar`s, `ParamSpec`s, `TypeVarTuple`s used and more. This was also the motivation behind this project, which automatically rewrites any code using old type parameter syntax to the new type parameter syntax using square brackets `[]`. 

# Installation
Using `pip`:
```
pip install autopep695
```
Using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):
```
uv tool install autopep695
```
Or if you want to run the tool immediately you can use:
```
uvx autopep695
```

# Usage

`autopep695` has 2 important commands for you to use on your codebase

## `autopep695 check`
Check whether the code makes use of the new type parameter syntax. If not, informative errors are shown that describe the problem (e.g. A class inherits from `typing.Generic[T]`) and include the "proper" implementation using the concepts described in PEP 695.

`autopep695 check` accepts multiple paths either pointing to a valid directory or a valid file that contains the code to be checked. A file is valid if it has one of the following extensions: `.py`, `.pyi`. Directories are traversed recursively.

Add the `--report-assignments` flag to enable type parameter assignment reports. Use `--no-code` to keep the output short and concise by removing code suggestions. You can also specify the `--silent` (`-s`) flag to silence the errors altogether and only show the number of errors reported.

## `autopep695 format`
Rewrite the code to the new type parameter syntax by running the `format` subcommand. This will implement all the suggestions reported in `autopep695 check`, so running `autopep695 check` after `autopep695 format` will not report any errors. `format` however does not require you to run `check` beforehand, it just matches its behaviour.

It is recommended to specify the `--parallel` (`-p`) flag if you're running `format` against a large codebase as the tool is written in pure python and is not optimized for speed. This way, the workload is distributed across multiple subprocesses, each spawning a new python interpreter that formats the assigned files.

The following flags can be specified for additional features:
- `--remove-variance`: Remove variance information from the name of the type parameter:
`T_co` -> `T`, `K_contra` -> `K`.
- `--remove-private`: Remove leading underscores that would have marked the type parameter as private: `_T` -> `T`, `__T` -> `T`, ... 
- `--keep-assignments`: Don't remove unused type parameter assignments 

## Excluding and including files
`autopep695` by default ignores the following paths:<br>
`.bzr`, `.direnv`, `.eggs`, `.git`, `.git-rewrite`, `.hg`, `.mypy_cache`, `.nox`, `.pants.d`, `.pytype`, `.ruff_cache`, `.svn`, `.tox`, `.venv`, `__pypackages__`, `_build`, `buck-out`, `dist`, `node_modules`, `venv`, `__pycache__`'

and includes the following file patterns:
`*.py`, `*.pyi`

You can change this behaviour by specifying the `--exclude` and `--include` flags which take any number of patterns to match against. Typically you will want to use `--extend-exclude` or `--extend-include` though, especially if you just want to add patterns to exclude or include, for example a file extension **in addition** to `.py` and `.pyi`.

# What `autopep695` does and doesn't do

`autopep695` does:
- Remove assignments that instantiate `TypeVar`s, `ParamSpec`s or `TypeVarTuple`s from `typing` or `typing_extensions`
- Rewrite type alias statements that are annotated using `typing.TypeAlias` or `typing_extensions.TypeAlias` to a `type` assigment e.g.:
```py
import typing as t
StrOrInt: t.TypeAlias = str | int
```
is turned into
```py
import typing as t
type StrOrInt = str | int
```
This rewrite is considered unsafe which is why you need to pass the `--unsafe` flag to `autopep695 format` for `autopep695` to format `TypeAlias` annotated assignments.
- Rewrite class definitions that use `TypeVar`s, `ParamSpec`s or `TypeVarTuple`s to conform to PEP 695 syntax e.g.:
```py
import typing as t

K = t.TypeVar("K")
V = t.TypeVar("V")

class Map(dict[K, V]): ...
```
is rewritten into
```py
import typing as t
class Map[K, V](dict[K, V]): ...
```
- Rewrite function definitions that use `TypeVar`s, `ParamSpec`s or `TypeVarTuple`s to conform to PEP 695, as long as the type parameter is not inherited from the outer annotation scope e.g.
```py
import typing as t
from collections.abc import Callable

T = t.TypeVar("T")
P = t.ParamSpec("P")

def func(callback: Callable[P, T]) -> T: ...
```
is converted to
```py
import typing as t
from collections.abc import Callable

def func[T, **P](callback: Callable[P, T]) -> T: ...
```
and
```py
import typing as t

T = t.TypeVar("T")

class Collection(t.Generic[T]):
    def add(self, item: T) -> None: ...
```
is correctly converted to
```py
import typing as t

class Collection[T]():
    def add(self, item: T) -> None: ...
```
- Remove `typing.Generic` or `typing_extensions.Generic` as base and the type subscript of `typing.Protocol` or `typing_extensions.Protocol` (`class A(typing.Protocol[T])` -> `class A[T](typing.Protocol)`)
- Correctly compile arguments passed in `TypeVar`, `ParamSpec` or `TypeVarTuple` to the equivalent PEP 695 syntax e.g.:
```py
import typing as t

class Undefined: ...

T = t.TypeVar("T", str, int, default=int)
UndefinedOr: t.TypeAlias = Undefined | T
```
is compiled to
```py
import typing as t

class Undefined: ...

type UndefinedOr[T: (str, int) = int] = Undefined | T
```
- allow you to ignore any type parameter related statement, simply add a `# pep695-ignore` comment to the line e.g.:
```py
import typing as t

T = t.TypeVar("T")

class A(t.Generic[T]): ... # pep695-ignore
```
will remain the exact same.

```py
import typing as t

T = t.TypeVar("T") # pep695-ignore
StrOr: t.TypeAlias = str | T
```
will compile to:
```py
import typing as t

T = t.TypeVar("T") # pep695-ignore
type StrOr = str | T
```
- account for codebases that mix old and new type parameter syntax, for those that found this tool in the midst of migrating
```py
import typing as t

V = t.TypeVar("V")

class Hello[K](t.MutableMapping[K, V]):
    ...
```
is translated to:
```py
import typing as t

class Hello[K, V](t.MutableMapping[K, V]):
    ...
```

`autopep695` does not:
- Remove unused imports once type assignments are removed, that's out of scope for this project.
- Fix imports that try to import a type parameter variable from another module which has been deleted after running `autopep695 format`
- Does not neccesarily follow the style of your next best linter

It is best to format the code with a tool like [`ruff`](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) after running `autopep695 format`.
